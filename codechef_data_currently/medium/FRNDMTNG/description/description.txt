  Chef and his friend Yurii decided to meet in the cafe. As they are very busy one would not wait for another too long. Namely, after arriving, Chef will spend at most  t1 seconds waiting for Yurii while Yurii will wait no more than t2 seconds.
Chef can arrive at any moment within [0..T1] with equal probability. Similarly Yurii can arrive at any moment within [0..T2].
Arrival time may be any real number from the interval.
Chef asks you to calculate the probability of meeting his friend Yurii in the cafe.
Input
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First and the only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers \u2013 T1, T2, t1 and t2.
Output
For each test case, output one the single real number - probability of meeting Chef and his friend Yurii. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10-6.
Constraints

1 \u2264 T \u2264 105
1 \u2264 T1, T2  \u2264 109 
0 \u2264 t1, t2  \u2264 109 


Subtask 1: (5 points)

t1 = 0 and t2 = 0


Subtask 2: (15 points)

t1 = 0 or t2 = 0


Subtask 3: (25 points)

1 \u2264 T \u2264 5
1 \u2264 T1, T2 \u2264 10
The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10-2
