  
Your task is simple. 
You need to find the value of .
As the value could be too large, output it modulo M.

Input

The first contains an integer T, denoting the number of the test cases. 
Then there are T lines, each describing a single test case and contains two space separated integers N and M respectively. 
Output
For each test case, output the value of summation modulo M on a separate line.
Constraints

1 \u2264  M  \u2264 100000 

There are two types of datasets:

 1 \u2264 N \u2264 106 , 1 \u2264 T \u2264 3000 
 106 \u2264 N \u2264 1010 , 1 \u2264 T \u2264 30 

Example
Input:
1
4 1000

Output:
373
Explanation
14*4 + 24*2 + 34*1 + 44*1 = 373
