  Nobody knows, but N frogs live in Chef's garden.
Now they are siting on the X-axis and want to speak to each other. One frog can send a message to another one if the distance between them is less or equal to K. 
Chef knows all P pairs of frogs, which want to send messages. Help him to define can they or not! 
Note : More than 1 frog can be on the same point on the X-axis.

Input

The first line contains three integers N, K and P. 
 The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the x-coordinates of frogs". 
 Each of the next P lines contains two integers A and B denoting the numbers of frogs according to the input. 

\u00a0
Output

For each pair print "Yes" without a brackets if frogs can speak and "No" if they cannot.

Explanation
For pair (1, 2) frog 1 can directly speak to the frog 2 as the distance between them is 3 - 0 = 3 <= K . 
For pair (1, 3) frog 1 can send a message to frog 2, frog 2 can send it to frog 4 and it can send it to frog 3.
For pair (2, 5) frogs can't send a message under current constraints.
