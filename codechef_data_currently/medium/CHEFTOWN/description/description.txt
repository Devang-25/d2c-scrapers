Imagine, that we have a segment [L,R].
Let K=R-L+1 be the length of this segment, and B be a list of heights of the buildings that belong to this segment.
Let's sort B in non-decreasing order.
Segment [L,R] is interesting if B[i]-B[i-1]=1 for every i (2

Help him and find out the number of different parades of length W, which can be hold in the city. Two parades ([L1,R1] and [L2,R2]) are considered to be different, if L1≠L2 or R1≠R2.
